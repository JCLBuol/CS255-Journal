Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass wanted a system designed that would help people learn and practice for both the driving and written tests to get their drivers license.  The system would allow users to study for the written exam and take practice tests to check their knowladge and it would let them schedual driving practice with one of the DriverPass instructors.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I did the analysis of the system requirements well.  

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would break up my explination of the requirements into easier to read points like a bulleted list.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

By going through the transcrips of the meeting with DriverPass I was able to find what the users would need when using this system.  The user's needs are a very important thing to consider when designing a system because if it is cumbersome and hard to use then no matter how good of a system you design no one will want to use it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software would be to first get as detailed of a list as I can as to what I need to be designing.  Then look into exactly what would need to be done to accomplish that and try to break the system down into parts.  Then I would reevaluate each part again to get a more detailed design of the indavidual parts.
